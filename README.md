# DevMountain Project - Journal Objective-C

## Description 
Journal is an iOS application to practice MVC separation, protocols, master-detail interfaces, table views, and persistence. After building this project in Swift multiple times, I sought to familiarize myself with Objective-C through building Journal.

## What I Learned

* Understand basic model-view-controller design and implementation
* Create a custom model object with a memberwise initializer
* Understand, create, and use a shared instance
* Create and implement model object controller with create, read, update, and delete functions
* How to implement the Equatable protocol
* Implement a master-detail interface
* Implement the UITableViewDataSource protocol
* Understand and implement the UITextFieldDelegate protocol to dismiss the keyboard
* Create relationship segues in Storyboards
* Understand, use, and implement the 'updateViews' pattern
* Implement 'prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?)' to configure destination view controllers
* Add data persistence using the Codable protocol and write data to a local file path (URL)
* Upon launch, decode the data returned from the local file path (URL) back into our custom model objects
